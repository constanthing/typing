# Typing Practice
### Bugs
- Speed is null when starting to type for ~1 second then back to normal
- Paragraph text overflows when you start typing.
= remains that way on new quotes... 
### TODO
- if input disabled change its color
- Prevent any key from starting quote sequence... (exmaple I can press alt and it starts)
- Add history
- Different type of quote categories
- Cache system to save history
- Maybe save finishedTime and call calculate() based on that when quote is finished?
- Add statistics page (shows graphs, history, etc.)
#### For Fun
- Add scorestreaks
- Add sound effects (i.e. when spacing on new word without typing, error, etc...)

### Learned
- e.preventDefault() stops letter from being placed
