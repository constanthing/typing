# Typing Practice
### Bugs
- Speed is null when starting to type for ~1 second then back to normal
- Skipping last word doesn't remove indicator (stays at letter where skipped) 
= doesn't clear input either
### TODO
- Prevent any key from starting quote sequence... (exmaple I can press alt and it starts)
- Add history
- Different type of quote categories
- Cache system to save history
#### For Fun
- Add scorestreaks
- Add sound effects (i.e. when spacing on new word without typing, error, etc...)

### Learned
- e.preventDefault() stops letter from being placed
